# Python-CFG-Kick-Starter
The Learning journey for Python
During the 8 week course I learnt multiple skills with regards to Python from about variables, problem solving, decision making with if statements, lists and dictionaries, files, PIP and APIs.
During this course I created my first project and worked with a partner to showcase our work.
